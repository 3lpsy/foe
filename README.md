# A Search and Destroy Game

In foe, players start with a set number of pawns on the board. After the players have joined and confirmed their starting positions, they can make a single move each round. They can either move a certain number (3 by default) spaces or shoot at another player's pawn that is certain number spaces (3 by default) away.

At the moment, the project only consists of a backend, thought a frontend may be developed over time.
